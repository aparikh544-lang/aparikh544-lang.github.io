        <p class="p">Welcome to the OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer) Algorithms section of Cubing 101! Here, you'll find a comprehensive list of algorithms to help you master the OLL step in solving the Rubik's Cube.<br>
        OLL is a crucial step in the CFOP method, where the goal is to orient all the pieces of the last layer so that the entire top face is a single color. This section provides detailed algorithms for each of the 57 possible OLL cases, along with tips and tricks to execute them efficiently.</p>
