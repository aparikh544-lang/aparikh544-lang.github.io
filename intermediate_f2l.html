        <p class="p">Welcome to the Intermediate F2L section of Cubing 101! Here, you'll find a collection of intermediate topics designed to help you efficiently solve the First Two Layers (F2L) of the Rubik's Cube.</p>
        <p class="p">Most of these topics are intended for cubers who are already familiar with basic F2L techniques and are looking to enhance their solving skills. Mastering these topics can lead to faster solve times and improved efficiency.</p>

        <h4 class="h4">Logical F2L</h4>
        <h6 class="h6">Recommendation: Any Level</h6>
        <p class="p">While trying to master F2L, it is necessary you know how F2L works the logical way. You'll understand that you don't have to memorize the full 41 algorithms for each case, but rather know the basic patterns of F2L (also listed in our Basic F2L section). You should practice this until it feels natural.</p>
    
        <h4 class="h4">Advanced F2L</h4>
        <h6 class="h6">Recommendation: Sub-30</h6>
        <p class="p">Once you've mastered intuitive F2L techniques, you can move on to advanced F2L. Intuitive F2L has lots of steps and can take a long time. This is where advanced F2L comes into play. For example, instead of taking the pair out and then pairing it, you can do both at the same time! The best way to learn advanced F2L is to watch walkthrough solves as they can teach good habits and situational tricks.</p>
