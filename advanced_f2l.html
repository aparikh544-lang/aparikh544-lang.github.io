        <p class="p">Welcome to the Advanced F2L section of Cubing 101! Here, you'll find a collection of advanced topics designed to help you efficiently solve the First Two Layers (F2L) of the Rubik's Cube.</p>
        <p class="p">Most of these topics are intended for cubers who are already familiar with basic F2L techniques and are looking to enhance their solving skills. Mastering these topics can lead to faster solve times and improved efficiency.</p>

        <h4 class="h4">F2L Lookahead</h4>
        <h6 class="h6">Recommendation: Sub-20</h6>
        <p class="p">F2L Lookahead is the ability to plan your next F2L pair while solving the current one. This skill is crucial for reducing pauses between moves and improving overall solve times. To practice lookahead, try slowing down your solves and focusing on identifying the next pair while completing the current one. Over time, this will become more intuitive and lead to smoother solves.</p>

        <h4 class="h4">F2L Efficiency and Optimization</h4>
        <h6 class="h6">Recommendation: Sub-15</h6>
        <p class="p">Once you're comfortable with F2L lookahead, it's time to focus on efficiency and optimization. This involves analyzing your F2L solves to identify unnecessary moves and finding ways to reduce your move count. Techniques such as minimizing rotations, using fewer regrips, and optimizing pair insertion can significantly enhance your F2L efficiency. Regularly reviewing your solves and seeking feedback from more experienced cubers can help you refine your techniques.</p>
