        <h4 class="h4">Finger Tricks</h4>
        <p class="p">Finger tricks are essential for improving your cubing speed. They allow you to execute moves more quickly and efficiently. Here are some common finger tricks to practice:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>R, R', L, and L' moves with your wrists (fairly easy) </li>
            <li>U and U' moves with your index finger</li>
            <li>F and F' moves with your index finger and thumb respectively</li>
            <li>B and B' moves with your index or pinky finger</li>
            <li>D and D' moves with your pinky finger</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">Of course these are only some of the finger tricks needed, but most finger tricks rely on the position of your hands and the cube.</p>

        <h4 class="h4">Efficient Algorithms</h4>
        <p class="p">Learning efficient algorithms can significantly reduce your solve times. Here are a few examples:</p>
