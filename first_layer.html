        <p class="p">Welcome to the First Layer tutorial of Cubing 101! In this section, we will guide you through the steps to solve the first layer of the Rubik's Cube, focusing on creating the cross and positioning the corner pieces.</p>
        <h4 class="h4">Step 1: Solving the Cross</h4>
        <p class="p">Our goal in this step is to create a cross on one face of the cube by correctly positioning the edge pieces. In this tutorial we will be making the white cross, but you can make any colored cross you want. Follow along to learn how to create the cross.</p>
        <h6 class="h6">Step 1a: Forming the Daisy</h6>

        <p class="p">Start by forming a "daisy" pattern on the yellow face (opposite the white face). The daisy consists of four white edge pieces surrounding the yellow center piece. To do this, locate each white edge piece and position them around the yellow center</p>
        <h6 class="h6">Step 1b: Aligning the Edges</h6>
        <img src="beginner_images/aligned_edge.png" alt="Aligning Edges" class="img">
        <p class="p">Once you have formed the daisy, the next step is to align the white edge pieces with their corresponding center pieces on the adjacent faces. Rotate the top layer to match each white edge piece with the center piece of the same color on the side faces.</p>
        <h6 class="h6">Step 1c: Inserting the Edges</h6>
        <img src="beginner_images/white_cross_down.png" alt="White Cross" class="img">
        <p class="p">After aligning the edges, you can now insert them into the white face to form the cross. Make sure that the color on the white edge (obviously not the white one) matches with the color on the center piece. Insert by rotating that layer twice.</p>
        <h4 class="h4">Step 2: Inserting the Corner Pieces</h4>
        <p class="p">With the cross completed, the next step is to position the corner pieces of the first layer. The goal is to place each corner piece in its correct position</p>
        <h6 class="h6">Step 2a: Bringing the Corner Into the Bottom Layer</h6>
        <img src="beginner_images/corner_piece.png" alt="Inserting the Corner" class="img">
        <p class="p">Begin by finding your corner. If it is already in the bottom layer, you can skip this step. But if it is in the top layer, use the following algorithm to bring it to the bottom layer:</p>
        <p class="p"><strong>R' D' R D</strong></p>
        <h6 class="h6">Step 2b: Inserting the Corner</h6>
        <img src="beginner_images/first_layer.png" alt="Finished First Layer" class="img">
        <p class="p">Once the corner piece is in the bottom layer, repeat the <b>above</b> algorithm until the corner is correctly inserted into the first layer.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong>Repeat this for all the other corners until you have a complete first layer.</strong></p>
