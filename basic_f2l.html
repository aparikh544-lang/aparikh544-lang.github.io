        <p class="p">Welcome to the Basic F2L Algorithms section of Cubing 101! Here, you'll find a collection of fundamental algorithms designed to handle common F2L cases on the Rubik's Cube.</p>
        <p class="p">These basic algorithms are intended for cubers who are new to F2L techniques and are looking to build a strong foundation. Below, you'll find a series of steps to help you tackle even the most common F2L scenarios.</p>
        <h4 class="h4">Step 1: Find Your Pair</h4>
        <p class="p">Locate the corner and edge pieces that form the F2L pair you want to solve.</p>
        <h4 class="h4">Step 2: Position the Pair</h4>
        <p class="p">Use basic moves to position the pair above its target slot.</p>
        <h4 class="h4">Step 3: Insert the Pair</h4>
        <p class="p">Execute the appropriate algorithm to insert the pair into its slot.</p>
